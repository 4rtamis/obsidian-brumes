# Brumes - City of Mist Obsidian Theme

Brumes is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) theme based on the award-winning tabletop role-playing game [City of Mist](https://cityofmist.co/). It aims to imitate the overall style of the City of Mist rulebooks and to provide easy-to-use features for the MC to easily prepare her cases.

## Roadmap

-   [x] Refactoring the overall code structure from theme to plugin
-   [ ] Adding a _City of Mist_ light theme preset
-   [ ] Adding a _City of Mist_ dark theme preset
-   [ ] Adding a _Legend in the Mist_ light theme preset
-   [ ] Refactoring callouts to make them more interactive (clues, description, moves)
-   [ ] Refactoring dangers to make them fully interactive (no more HTML)
-   [ ] Refactoring tags, statuses and spectrums to make them fully interactive (no more HTML)
-   [ ] Creating a whole new Iceberg view (no more canvas hack)
-   [ ] Releasing a comprehensive documentation
-   [ ] Releasing an installation video tutorial
